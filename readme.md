## building and running locally

In order to get up and running locally, you'll need to:

1. pull down the project
1. if you use nvm, run `nvm use` to make sure you're on a compatible version of node
1. run `npm install` from the project root
1. make sure gulp is installed globally: `npm install -g gulp`
1. run `gulp` (this will build the js file and css file that the browser will use and will continue to listen to changes to source files)
1. go to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome or `about:debugging` in Firefox
1. make sure "Developer mode" is on if you're on Chrome
1. click "Load unpacked extension..." on Chrome or "Load Temporary Add-on"
1. choose the project root directory for Chrome or a zipped directory by gulp for Firefox (via `gulp prod`), and you should be good to go!
